## 🚀 MERN Stack Backend Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Backend Series Projects** repository!  
This collection showcases the projects I've built as part of my journey learning the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**.

---

### 📚 About

Each project in this folder demonstrates key concepts of **backend development** —  
from setting up **RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express**,  
handling **authentication with JWT**,  
integrating **MongoDB for data storage**,  
to managing **file uploads**,  
implementing **middleware**, and much more.

### 📦 What's Inside

🔐 User Authentication systems  
🛒 E-commerce functionality (cart, product management, order flow)  
📁 File/image uploads using **Multer**  
🧠 Middleware & route protection  
🧩 Modular code structures and utility functions  
💾 MongoDB & Mongoose-based data models  

---

### 🎯 Purpose

To track my learning, improve through practice,  
and ultimately become confident in **full-stack web development**.  
This repo reflects my growth step-by-step.

### 💡 What's Next?

I'm now transitioning to the **frontend** side using **React.js**,  
where I'll be combining backend logic with modern UIs  
for a complete full-stack experience.
